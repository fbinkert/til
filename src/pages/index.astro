<BaseLayout title="TIL: Today I Learned">
  <div class="index-content framed">
    <h1 id="About">About this TIL</h1>
    <p>I learn a lot and forget faster, so I keep this TIL: a searchable stash of
    notes worth keeping. Each entry is one note I can find later. Writing makes
    it stick and saves future me time. There is no rigid format. I write what’s
    useful to me. It’s both a memory aid and a progress log.</p>
